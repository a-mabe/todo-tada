# To-do Tada

A fully open source visual to-do list [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) application.

This app is currently **in progress and actively under developement**. Feel free to utilize GitHub issues, particularly the enhancement (feature request) tag, to suggest things as I'm developing the app.

For more detailed information on the design, development status, and implementation of the app, please [see the wiki](https://github.com/a-mabe/todo-tada/wiki).
