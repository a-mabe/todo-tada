# Overview

This app is a drag and drop visual to-do list. Each icon is supposed to represent a to-do list item, and dragging an icon from "To-do" to "Done" is a very rewarding action. Implementing a list in this manner makes it easy to visual see how many items need completed, how many have been completed, and exactly what each to-do item entails.
