# Overview

This app is a drag and drop visual to-do list. Each icon is supposed to represent a to-do list item, and dragging an icon from "To-do" to "Done" is a very rewarding action. Implementing a list in this manner makes it easy to visual see how many items need completed, how many have been completed, and exactly what each to-do item entails.

## Status

The workflow for this app utilizes [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/a-mabe/todo-tada/projects).

* [Generic To-do Lists](https://github.com/a-mabe/todo-tada/projects/2) covers the basic functionality of the to-do list app.
* [Daily Lists Screen](https://github.com/a-mabe/todo-tada/projects/1) expands on the general to-do list functionaly by allowing lists to be created for and sorted by specific dates.
